# Super-Smash-Bros-Mod
This is the Super Smash Bros Mod
To begin let us just tell you a bit about the mod
The mod was a project started quite a few months ago which derives its inspiration from the game Super Smash Bros
this series has four games.
Super Smash Bros (64)
Super Smash Bros Melee (GameCube)
Super Smash Bros Brawl (Wii)
Super Smash Bros 3ds / WiiU (3ds / WiiU)

so what does this mod do. Well you just have to look for it yourself. We dont want to spoil everything for you!!! ;)
Right now the mod is in early alpha and is still in the works. When the mod is finished it will be on the minecraft forums. This is just the java classes for the mod and its assets. Nothing more Nothing less. This is not the mod itself. We are not going to spoil anything the mod has to offer. At least not right now.
